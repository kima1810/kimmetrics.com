									<p>My name is Alex Kim and I am 23 years old. I graduated from Ohio State in 2025 with a degree in computer science.
										I grew up playing hockey, running track, and I also took a crack at competitive skiing and roller hockey in college. Lately I've been collaborating as a developer with
										Reborn Sports Network.
									</p>
									<p>
										The idea of KIMMETRICS was born when I created an overcomplicated predictive model for March Madness. While this kind of overthinking seemed counterintuitive, it garnered
										some surprisingly good results. I realized I had a lot of ideas and small excel sheets from one-off research I had done and it would be great to have a place to share that.
