									<h2>An Introduction to Trade Trees</h2>

									<p>
										Five years ago, 18-year old me sat doom scrolling on YouTube, looking for an interesting video to watch because the world had stopped and there
										was nothing to do. I couldn't go outside, hang out with my friends, and worst of all, there were no sports being played. That's when I came across
										<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIGIlYSEkwQ&list=PLo12SYwt93STnVXNy8XYOSLP4IMBrMhDr">a Sportsnet video series titled <em>Trade Trees</em></a>, 
										where a man who goes by the name of Steve Dangle highlights a certain trade that had happened at some point in NHL history, and breaks down how
										the trade evolved over time and what the pieces of the deal were traded for down the line. From that moment, I was instantly hooked and for the next
										few years, I enjoyed when Steve would bless my timeline with a new series of NHL trade trees every summer. That was until the summer of 2022, when
										Steve Dangle announced he was going to be leaving Sportsnet and move onto making his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SDPN">Steve Dangle Podcast Network</a>
										a separate entity, which also ended the Trade Tree series. While I still enjoy listening to his podcast and video breakdowns, there has not been a new Trade
										Tree video in almost three years. That's where I come in to carry on the legacy. Every Sunday during the sports dead season during the summer, I will be posting
										a trade tree that I have researched, and it won't just be limited to hockey. Some trees are much larger than others and those may take an extra week, but I will aim
										to stick to this weekly schedule.
									</p>
									<p>So, without further ado, here is the first <em>Trade Tree Sunday</em>!</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>
										During the 2025 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns shocked NFL fans when they traded back from the second overall pick to the fifth overall pick
										with the Jacksonville Jaguars, who wanted to move up and pick Travis Hunter. The Browns received a massive haul in return.
									</p>
									<p>The trade was as follows:</p>

									<div class="box">
										<h3>Jacksonville Jaguars receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2025 1st round pick (#2)</li>
											<li>2025 4th round pick (#104)</li>
											<li>2025 6th round pick (#200)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>2697.4</strong></p>
									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Cleveland Browns receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2025 1st round pick (#5)</li>
											<li>2025 2nd round pick (#36)</li>
											<li>2025 4th round pick (#126)</li>
											<li>2026 1st round pick (TBD)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>2876</strong></p>
									</div>

									<p>
										Now, receiving an additional first and second round pick to move back three spots in the first round and 22 spots in the fourth round seems
										like a fairly strong return. According to the classic <a href="https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp">Jimmy Johnson Trade Value Model</a>,
										this trade favors Cleveland by a value of 1188.6 (the model assumes Jacksonville's 2026 first round selection will be sixth overall. If
										the Jaguars were to somehow win the Super Bowl in 2026, Cleveland's advantage would be cut down to 178.6).
									</p>
									<p>
										However, things may not be as great as they seem, because this is not the first time the Browns have received a massive haul after trading back
										in the first round of the draft. In fact, they have done this several times in the past, to little success. While there are many examples to choose
										from, including <a href="https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2016/5/7/11613916/reviewing-the-cleveland-browns-2016-nfl-draft">a series of trade-backs in the 2016 draft</a>,
										I opted to highlight a trade from the 2011 draft, and perhaps save some of the other ones for a later date.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Context</h2>
									<p>
										The 2011 NFL Draft was loaded with talent. In fact, eight of the top ten picks made multiple Pro Bowls and were named All-Pro at least once. 
										with talent like that available at the top of the draft, some teams sought to move up and acquire their next franchise piece. The Browns, coming
										off a 5-11 season, where they missed the playoffs for an eighth year in a row, held the sixth-overall pick, but one player wasn't going to save
										this sinking ship. They were open to trading back and accumulating more capital for later, but they needed to find the right trade partner.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Atlanta Falcons were in the opposite position at the time, having just finished 13-3 and securing the top seed in the NFC. Unfortunately, they
										would fall to the Packers 48-21 in the Divisional Round, but the team was looking strong and ready to be a true contender in the league for years to come. 
										With a 25-year-old Matt Ryan under center, the Falcons saw the opportunity to move up and give him an elite weapon to form a deadly duo with.
									</p>
									<p>
										With Cleveland looking to trade back, Atlanta looking to trade up, and a certain receiver falling to the sixth pick, the Browns found their
										match.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Trade</h2>
									<p>Because of their successful 2010 season, the Falcons held the 26th overall selection, and paid a hefty price to move up.</p>

									<div class="box">
										<h3>Atlanta Falcons receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2011 1st round pick (#6)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>1600</strong></p>
									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Cleveland Browns receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2011 1st round pick (#26)</li>
											<li>2011 2nd round pick (#59)</li>
											<li>2011 4th round pick (#124)</li>
											<li>2012 1st round pick (#22)</li>
											<li>2012 4th round pick (#118)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>1896</strong></p>
									</div>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What Atlanta Got</h2>
									
									<h3>2011 1st round pick (#6)</h3>
									<p>
										With that many additional picks going the other way, you'd hope the Falcons were sure about the guy they traded up for, and fortunately for them,
										they did. Sixth overall, the falcons selected Alabama receiver <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoneJu02.htm">Julio Jones</a>.
										There's not much I can add that hasn't already been said about Jones. He played ten seasons with the Falcons, totalling 12,896 yards and 60 touchdowns,
										and to add to that he lead the league in receiving yards twice, made seven Pro Bowls, was named first team All-Pro twice as well as second team All-Pro 
										three times, and should be a lock for the Hall of Fame. He also played in eight playoff games with the Falcons, adding 834 receiving yards and six touchdowns.
										His 334 yards and three touchdowns in the 2016 playoffs even helped Atlanta make a run to the Super Bowl, where they tragically lost in a now-infamous game.
										Trading up twenty spots can go horribly wrong, but in 2011, the Falcons took that gamble and it paid off.
									</p>
									<p>
										To put a cherry on top of this trade for Atlanta, they were able to trade Julio Jones as well. <strong>The Falcons sent Jones and a 2023 6th round pick
										to the Titans for a 2022 2nd round pick and a 2023 4th round pick</strong>, and so far, it seems like they've hit on both of those picks as well. 
										The 2022 2nd round pick was used on linkebacker <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AndeTr00.htm">Troy Andersen</a> out of Montana State, who
										has been a reliable rotational linebacker for the last three seasons, and <strong>the 2023 4th round pick was thrown in to help the Falcons move up in the second round
										of the 2023 draft</strong>, where they selected Syracuse guard <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BergMa00.htm">Matthew Bergeron</a>, who is currently
										the starting left guard on the falcons.
									</p>

									<p>
										They say whoever gets the best player in the deal wins the deal, and the Falcons set a very high bar, but let's see if the Browns could at least get a competitive return
										out of the five picks they received.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What Cleveland Got</h2>
									
									<h3>2011 1st round pick (#26)</h3>
									<p>
										The Browns traded back 20 spots, but didn't hold onto the 26th pick for long as they <strong>packaged it with the 70th pick to move
										up five spots to pick 21</strong>, and with the 21st overall pick, the Browns selected defensive tackle <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylPh00.htm">Phil Taylor</a>.
										Unfortunately, this was not a great start to this trade for the Browns. Taylor spent four seasons with the Browns, where in 44 games, he had 109
										tackles and 7 sacks. The Browns did pick up his fifth year option, which is usually a good sign for the Browns, but Phil Taylor was released on an injury
										settlement ahead of the 2015 season and never saw another snap in the NFL. Pro Football Reference gives every player an <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/about/approximate_value.htm">
										<em>approximate value score</em> (AV)</a>, which gives a vague idea of how valuable a player was throughout his career. Phil Taylor's AV was 19,
										which ranks 149th among the 2011 draft class. To make matters worse for the Browns, the Chiefs, who they traded the 26th pick to, took receiver 
										<a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BaldJo00.htm">Jonathan Baldwin</a> in the first round, who only had an AV of 4 for his career, 
										but with the 70th pick they selected linebacker <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HousJu00.htm">Justin Houston</a>, 
										who had four pro-bowl seasons and one All-Pro season with the Chiefs and is still playing 15 years later.
									</p>
									<p>Cleveland may have gotten off to a bad start, but they had four more picks including another first, so hopefully they got some value out of this trade.</p>

									<h3>2011 2nd round pick (#59) & 2011 4th round pick (#124)</h3>
									<p>
										Unfortunately, Cleveland's next two picks weren't homeruns either. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LittGr00.htm">Greg Little</a>,
										a receiver out of North Carolina was taken with the 59th pick. He 3 seasons in Cleveland and had a statline of 155 receptions for 1,821 yards
										and 8 touchdowns before being waived after the 2013 season. While he was never a Prow Bowler, you can certainly do much worse with a late second round pick.
										With the fourth round pick, the Browns selected running back <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MareOw00.htm">Owen Marecic</a>
										out of Stanford, but he only laster two seasons with the team, only totalling 39 yards of offense in his entire career. These two players had a combined
										AV of 12, all of which came from Greg Little.
									</p>
									<p>With the three 2011 picks out of the way and the return not being remotely close to Julio Jones so far, the Browns had two picks in 2012 to salvage this trade.</p>

									<h3>2012 1st round pick (#22)</h3>
									<p>
										The Browns desperately needed a quarterback around this time, as <a>Colt McCoy</a> lead them to a measly 4-win season in 2011. So, 22nd overall in 2012, they
										selected their next franchise quarterback... <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WeedBr00.htm">Brandon Weeden</a>. Let's just say, there was a
										reason Greg Little struggled on the Browns. Weeden started 20 games over two seasons for the Browns, throwing for 5,116 yards, 23 touchdowns, and 26 interceptions,
										before he was released during the 2014 offseason. From there, Weeden bounced around the league as a backup for four more seasons.
									</p>
									<p>Well, the Browns had one last pick to save them. Could they find a diamond in the rough of the 4th round?</p>

									<h3>2012 4th round pick (#118)</h3>
									<p>
										The final pick of this trade was an interesting one, as it was not actually used by the Browns at all. In addition to the 22nd overall pick, Cleveland also still
										held their own first round pick which was fourth overall, but this was a very coveted draft because a lot of teams wanted to move up to draft one of the top three
										prospects. So, after Washington had moved up to the second overall pick to take their franchise quarterback, the Browns saw the opportunity to move up one spot
										and secure their guy as well. <strong>Cleveland traded the 118th overall pick, along with the 139th and 211th overall picks to move up one spot in the draft
										to third overall</strong>. There, they selected Alabama running back <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RichTr00.htm">Trent Richardson</a>.
										Richardson had a lot of hype coming out of college and the Browns thought they were creating a two-headed monster in the backfield with Trent Richardson and
										Peyton Hillis, who'd just been named the cover athlete of Madden 12, and Richardson did put up a solid rookie season, rushing for 950 yards and 11 touchdowns,
										while adding an additional 367 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown. It seemed like the Browns had finally gotten their guy and saved themselves from trade
										tree infamy.
									</p>
									<p>
										That was until they inexplicably traded him to the Colts two games into his sophomore season. <strong>The Colts traded a 2014 first round pick to the
										Browns in exchange for Richardson</strong>, which sadly derailed his career, as he was out of the league by 2015. As for who the Browns took with that pick,
										<strong>Cleveland packaged the pick, which was 26th overall, with the 83rd overall pick to move up to the 22nd overall pick</strong>, and 22nd overall,
										the Browns selected quarterback <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/ManzJo00.htm">Johnny Manziel</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										I won't dwell on Manziel much since most football fans know his story very well, but the sparknotes are that he was a very talented quarterback,
										who didn't pan out because of primarily off-the-field issues. He only started eight games in his career, throwing for 1,675 yards, seven touchdowns,
										and seven interceptions. Then, he was released by the Browns in 2016, which ends this trade tree.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>
										If you combine the DrAV (approximate value for just the team that drafted the player) of all 6 players the Browns drafted in this tree, you get
										a total AV of 42. Julio Jones alone contributed an AV of 97 for the Falcons. You can analyze the value of draft picks all you want and say the Browns
										got a great return trading back 3 spots in the most recent draft, but that value only matters if you can hit on the picks, which the Browns have
										consistently proven they struggle to do. With that said, the players the Browns selected with the picks they've been able to use so far do look promising
										(despite <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/browns-rookie-rb-quinshon-judkins-arrested-on-charge-of-misdemeanor-domestic-violence">one of those players having recently gotten into legal trouble</a>),
										but only time will tell if the trade will go down as a steal for them, or another failed trade back in a long line of poor draft decisions for the Browns.
