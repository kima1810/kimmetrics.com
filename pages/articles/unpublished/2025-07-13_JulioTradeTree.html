									<h2>An Introduction to Trade Trees</h2>

									<p>
										Five years ago, 18-year old me sat doom scrolling on YouTube, looking for an interesting video to watch because the world had stopped and there
										was nothing to do. I couldn't go outside, hang out with my friends, and worst of all, there were no sports being played. That's when I came across
										<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIGIlYSEkwQ&list=PLo12SYwt93STnVXNy8XYOSLP4IMBrMhDr">a Sportsnet video series titled <em>Trade Trees</em></a>, 
										where a man who goes by the name of Steve Dangle highlights a certain trade that had happened at some point in NHL history, and breaks down how
										the trade evolved over time and what the pieces of the deal were traded for down the line. From that moment, I was instantly hooked and for the next
										few years, I enjoyed when Steve would bless my timeline with a new series of NHL trade trees every summer. That was until the summer of 2022, when
										Steve Dangle announced he was going to be leaving Sportsnet and move onto making his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SDPN">Steve Dangle Podcast Network</a>
										a separate entity, which also ended the Trade Tree series. While I still enjoy listening to his podcast and video breakdowns, there has not been a new Trade
										Tree video in almost three years. That's where I come in to carry on the legacy. Every Sunday during the sports dead season during the summer, I will be posting
										a trade tree that I have researched, and it won't just be limited to hockey. Some trees are much larger than others and those may take an extra week, but I will aim
										to stick to this weekly schedule.
									</p>
									<p>So, without further ado, here is the first <em>Trade Tree Sunday</em>!</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>
										During the 2025 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns shocked NFL fans when they traded back from the second overall pick to the fifth overall pick
										with the Jacksonville Jaguars, who wanted to move up and pick Travis Hunter. The Browns received a massive haul in return.
									</p>
									<p>The trade was as follows:</p>

									<div class="box">
										<h3>Jacksonville Jaguars receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2025 1st round pick (#2)</li>
											<li>2025 4th round pick (#104)</li>
											<li>2025 6th round pick (#200)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>2697.4</strong></p>
									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Cleveland Browns receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2025 1st round pick (#5)</li>
											<li>2025 2nd round pick (#36)</li>
											<li>2025 4th round pick (#126)</li>
											<li>2026 1st round pick (TBD)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>2876</strong></p>
									</div>

									<p>
										Now, receiving an additional first and second round pick to move back three spots in the first round and 22 spots in the fourth round seems
										like a fairly strong return. According to the classic <a href="https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp">Jimmy Johnson Trade Value Model</a>,
										this trade favors Cleveland by a value of 1188.6 (note: the model assumes Jacksonville's 2026 first round selection will be sixth overall. If
										the Jaguars were to somehow win the Super Bowl in 2026, Cleveland's advantage would be cut down to 178.6).
									</p>
									<p>
										However, things may not be as great as they seem, because this is not the first time the Browns have received a massive haul after trading back
										in the first round of the draft. In fact, they have done this several times in the past, to little success. While there are many examples to choose
										from, including <a href="https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2016/5/7/11613916/reviewing-the-cleveland-browns-2016-nfl-draft">a series of trade-backs in the 2016 draft</a>,
										I opted to highlight a trade from the 2011 draft, and perhaps save some of the other ones for a later date.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Context</h2>
									<p>
										The 2011 NFL Draft was loaded with talent. In fact, eight of the top ten picks made multiple Pro Bowls and were named All-Pro at least once. 
										with talent like that available at the top of the draft, some teams sought to move up and acquire their next franchise piece. The Browns, coming
										off a 5-11 season, where they missed the playoffs for an eighth year in a row, held the sixth-overall pick, but one player wasn't going to save
										this sinking ship. They were open to trading back and accumulating more capital for later, but they needed to find the right trade partner.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Atlanta Falcons were in the opposite position at the time, having just finished 13-3 and securing the top seed in the NFC. Unfortunately, they
										would fall to the Packers 48-21 in the Divisional Round, but the team was looking strong and ready to be a true contender in the league for years to come. 
										With a 25-year-old Matt Ryan under center, the Falcons saw the opportunity to move up and give him an elite weapon to form a deadly duo with.
									</p>
									<p>
										With Cleveland looking to trade back, Atlanta looking to trade up, and a certain receiver falling to the sixth pick, the Browns found their
										match.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Trade</h2>
									<p>Because of their successful 2010 season, the Falcons held the 26th overall selection, and paid a hefty price to move up.</p>

									<div class="box">
										<h3>Atlanta Falcons receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2011 1st round pick (#6)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>1600</strong></p>
									</div>
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Cleveland Browns receive</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>2011 1st round pick (#26)</li>
											<li>2011 2nd round pick (#59)</li>
											<li>2011 4th round pick (#124)</li>
											<li>2012 1st round pick (#22)</li>
											<li>2012 4th round pick (#118)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Total draft pick value: <strong>1896</strong></p>
									</div>
